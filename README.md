# Encryption Service Performance Report

## Test Environment
- **OS**: Windows
- **Architecture**: amd64
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X 8-Core Processor
- **Go Version**: 1.21+

## Benchmark Results

### Single Operation Performance
| Operation | Latency | Memory Usage | Allocations |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Encryption | 1,716 ns (1.7 μs) | 5,136 bytes | 5 |

### Performance Interpretation
- **Encryption Speed**: 1.7 microseconds per 1KB data
- **Theoretical Maximum**: ~583,000 encryptions per second
- **Memory Efficiency**: 5KB per operation with 5 allocations

### Real-World Projections
Based on 1.7μs per encryption:

| Scenario | Operations | Estimated Time |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1,000 files | 1,000 encryptions | 1.7 ms |
| 10,000 files | 10,000 encryptions | 17 ms |
| 100,000 files | 100,000 encryptions | 170 ms |
| 1,000,000 files | 1,000,000 encryptions | 1.7 seconds |

## Comparative Analysis

### vs. Other Languages (Estimated)
| Language | Expected Latency | Relative Performance |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Go** | 1.7 μs | 1.0x (baseline) |
| **C#** | ~2.5 μs | 0.7x |
| **Java** | ~3.0 μs | 0.6x |
| **Python** | ~12.0 μs | 0.14x |

## Optimization Notes
- Current implementation is highly efficient
- Minimal memory allocations (5/op) indicates good design
- 1.7μs latency is excellent for cryptographic operations

## Recommendations
- Suitable for high-throughput applications (100K+ ops/second)
- Memory usage is reasonable for the security level
- No immediate optimizations needed
